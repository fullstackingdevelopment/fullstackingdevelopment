        The FSD team is working on multiple Full-Stack applications.
        We're programmers seeking to develop our own skills and build interesting applications while doing so.
        All of our projects are open-source. We're more than happy to have contributors creating pull requests and issues.
        If you're interested in collaborating, simply go to the github page of one of our projects and make sure you read the contributors covenant.
